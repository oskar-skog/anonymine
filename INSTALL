DEPENDENCIES
============

    * Python 2.6, 2.7 or 3.x
    * The curses module. (Python bindings for curses.)
    * A screen size of at least 10 columns by 8 rows.
        (7 by 4 for non-hexagonal gametypes.)
    * A unix-like operating system or the argparse module.
    
    * less(1) for the passwords is recommended.
    * A unix-like OS is recommended for systems with multiple CPUs or
      multicore CPUs
    * PyPy or another faster Python implementation can be used.
    
    NOTICE: Normal installation will only work on unix-like operating
    systems.
    
    On unix-unlike systems you must specify the location of both
    configuration files, which is why the argparse module would
    be required on a non-nix platform.


INSTALLATION
============

    NOTICE: This section only applies to unix-like systems.
    
    In the directory extracted from the tarball, run:
        ./configure
        make
        make install        # as root
    
    If you don't understand the above, go read
http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/compile-install-tar-gz-tar-bz2-files-ubuntu-linux/
    If you still don't understand, ask the nearest Linux user to help you
    and create a wiki page about the topic on my Github repo.
    
    Use "./configure -v" to make the whole installation process verbose.

    NOTICE:
        The system-wide configuration files for the game will only be created
        if they do not exist or if they have not been modified by the user.
        `make install` will fail if the format of the configuration has
        changed and incompatible configuration files that have been modified
        exist.
        
        If you don't modify the system-wide configuration files, installation
        will not fail because of this.
        
        To force an overwrite of the system-wide configuration files, run
        `make overwrite-cfg`.  If you do this because of a failed make install,
        run make install again.
    
    
    Anonymine will be installed as 'anonymine'.
    
    Run "make print-destinations" to find out where files will be installed.
    
    
    Important notes
    ===============
    
        * System wide configuration files, even if altered, will be deleted
          on uninstall.
        * The highscores file will be deleted on uninstall.
        * Anonymine expects to be run by "python", not "python2.7" etc.
        * Do not make any target that is not listed in the list of Makefile
          targets.  If you know what you're doing, it's okay.
        * ./configure and Makefile are not made with the GNU Autotools.
          The build system may behave unexpectedly.


Advanced installation
=====================

    NOTICE: This section only applies to unix-like systems.
    
    
    ./configure; make; make install
    ===============================
    
        NOTICE: ./configure is not made with GNU Autoconf.
    
        ./configure will accept variables with three different syntaxes:
            ./configure --name value
            ./configure --name=value
            ./configure name=value
        
        All variables require exactly one value/argument.
        All variables will also be stored in the Makefile.
        
        The value of a variable MAY be a Makefile variable/macro.
        Ex: `./configure 'bindir=$(prefix)/bin'`
        
        You can override the variables stored in Makefile, but avoid
        overriding srcdir and builddir, those two should only be sent
        to ./configure.
        
        The value entered on the command line will not be pre-expanded in the
        Makefile, except for "builddir" and "srcdir".  The exception is there
        to prevent issues when make is run from a different directory than
        configure.
            "srcdir" and "builddir" will automatically be converted to absolute
            paths.
        
        configure will also accept these short options:
            -f      Force; write the Makefile even if there were errors.
            -v      verbose; this also affects the Makefile
        
        The real "configure" script will handle these iff they are the ONLY
        argument to ./configure:
            ./configure -h
            ./configure -V
            ./configure --help
            ./configure --version

        EXECUTABLES
        ===========
        
            This is the directory to which this game will be installed.
            
            It will be assigned to the first variable of [gamesdir, bindir]
            that expands into a path that exists in $PATH.
            
            As a consequence: The game will probably not be installed where
            you want it to if you specify bindir=somewhere-else as it installs
            to gamesdir rather than bindir whenever possible.
        
        
        MODULES
        =======
            
            This game works with both versions of Python, and installs three
            modules that could be used by some other program.
            
            The modules will be copied to $(MODULES).
            
            $(major) and $(minor) are pre-expanded and do NOT exist in the
            Makefile.
    
    
        srcdir, builddir and DESTDIR
        ============================
        
            srcdir          Directory extracted from the tarball.
            
            builddir        Temporary storage;
                            directory for files from the build process.
            
            DESTDIR         Prepended to all paths on install and uninstall;
                            alternative root.  (For staged installations.)
            
            
            $(srcdir) is the directory that was extracted from the tarball.
            $(builddir) is the directory where make(1) is allowed to create
            "temporary" files when building (`make [all]`) the program.
            
            Both srcdir and builddir default to the current working directory.
            
            Sending builddir=foo to ./configure will create the Makefile
            inside builddir. You can cd to builddir and run
            `make && sudo make install` without specifiying any arguments
            to make.
            
            You should only send srcdir and builddir to ./configure, not to
            make.
            
            DESTDIR only affects make install, make uninstall, etc.  It has
            zero effect on ./configure.
    
    
    Targets in the Makefile
    =======================
    
        NOTICE:  DO NOT attempt to make any other target than what is
        listed here.  `make` will not remake Makefile if you try to build
        any other target.
        
        all (default)
            Fix the shebang line of the programs to be installed
        
        clean
            Remove stage files and bytecode.
        
        distclean
            Like clean, but also remove the Makefile.
            rm $(builddir)Makefile
        
        print-destinations
            Print where things will be installed.
        
        install
            Altered configuration files will not be touched by this target.
            If the existing configuration file is incompatible but does not
            identify itself as unmodified, installation will fail and the
            configuration file must be manually edited.
        
        install-dirs
            Install the destination directories.
        
        uninstall
            This will remove the system-wide configuration files as well.
            WARNING: This removes the configuration files, even if altered.
            WARNING: This removed the highscores file.
        
        check-install-cfg
            Install system-wide configuration files, but do not overwrite
            user-modified files.  This target will fail if the existing
            configuration files have been modified and are not compatible
            with the new version of Anonymine.
        
        overwrite-cfg
            Force compatible configuration files to be installed.
            WARNING: User modified files will be overwritten.
        
        check
            Check that everything seems to work.
        
        release
            (You are me.)
        
        make dist
            'check' that I am not making an embarrassing release,
            make 'tarballs' and the 'zip' and 'release' them.
    
    
    Multiple Python versions or implementations
    ===========================================
    
        After having run "make", you can run
        "<python-implementation> symlinks install" in builddir,
        python-implementation is the command for the python implementation
        to which you want to install symlinks for the Anonymine modules.
        
        The "symlinks" script is generated during "make all".  If you want
        to use DESTDIR, you'll have to send DESTDIR to either `./configure`
        or `make`; you can't send it only to `make install`.
        
        "<python-implementation> symlinks unintstall" does what you should
        expect it to do.
        
        If the main version (the Python version to which the real files have
        been installed) has changed, run:
            ./configure -v # DESTDIR=foo
            make
            sudo make install
            oldpython symlinks install
            # (You need to install them before you uninstall them.)
            #oldpython symlinks uninstall


TL;DR
=====

    ./configure -v && make && sudo make install
