            for the other Python version. Removed $(MODULES_OTHERVER).
        * Makefile.static (build-freedesktop, build-macosx): Use Makefile as
            a Makefile.
        * Makefile.static (all etc), mk-symlinks: New file mk-symlinks that

2016-12-18      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.4.7
        * Makefile.static:
            - Use "$(MAKE)" instead of "make".
            - Made print-destinations print to stderr.

        * INSTALL: Many small corrections.
        * Makefile.static:
            - Made recursive make wrapper for install-dirs
            - `make install` depends on the internal targets.
              (Avoids unnecessary recursions.)
            - $(MAIN_STAGE) now depends on Makefile.vars too.
            - $(ENGINECFG_STAGE) now depends on Makefile.vars.
        * RELEASE-NOTES: Inform that 0.4.5 and 0.4.6 didn't fix issues

                reconfigure: Run ./configure with the same arguments
                Makefile.vars: Avoid running an unchanged ./configure again
            - Sort the order of Makefile variables.
        * INSTALL: srcdir and builddir should only bet sent to `./configure`.

2016-12-10      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.4.3
        * anonymine_solver.py: The PyPy bug has been tracked down to the
            `possibilities` function.   Bug fixed: used `is` instead of `==`
            when comparing a variable against a string literal.

        * anonymine_solver.py (solver_loop): Found a potential bug:
            `fail` was not set to False if a solvable cell was found.
        * anonymine_solver.py: Removed commented out profiling code.
        * anonymine_solver.py: (WRONG>>) Tracked down the PyPy bug to the
            number_neighbours function.  Uncomment the print and
            run pypybug() in test.py. (<<WRONG)

        *: Got rid of BUGS.  BUG descriptions have been moved into comments
            at relevant locations in the source and to Github issues.

2016-10-26      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.3.12
        * configure.py: Use `sys.exit` instead of `os._exit` as the latter
            caused weird issues with stream redirection.

2016-10-23      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.3.11
        * README: http://anonymine-demo.oskog97.com:8080/ link removed.

            gone.

    0.3.9
        * Forgotten Windows stuff, minor style fixes.
    0.3.8
        *: Removed Windows support.  (Going to create that in a different
            repo.)

    0.3.4
        * cursescfg: Use reverse video for the flags to make them more
            distinguishable on monochrome terminals.
        * anonymine_engine.py (hiscores (add_entry)): Failed to set
            display_caption when the player didn't make it to highscores.
        * Makefile.static: Added distclean.

2016-09-07      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.3.3
        * anonymine_engine.py (hiscores (add_entry)): list.index does not
            return None, but raises ValueError. Plus various changes for
            the fix.

2016-08-27      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>

2016-08-16      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>

        * INSTALL: Warn of the removal of configuration files.
    0.2.32
        * anonymine.py (highscores_display), cursescfg: Use pseudo-tab-ish
            spacing between the columns and make horizontal scrolling in less
            faster.
            NOTICE: `highscores_display` now takes four arguments.

2016-08-15      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.2.31
        * anonymine.py: Set LESSSECURE=1

2016-08-13      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.2.30
        * README: It works again on Minix 3.3 and openindiana.
        * configure.py [openindiana]: INSTALL_CMD was changed to INSTALL in
            Makefile.static at version 0.1.17.  I forgot to change it in
            configure.py as well.
        * INSTALL: Added "INSTALL" as a recognized variable
        * anonymine_engine.py [Minix]: Guess what, Python 2.7 on Minix 3.3
            has no math module. Created a really dumb replacement.
        * anonymine.py [Minix]: Can't import subprocess either. Piping to
            less will fail, but that's a tolerable error.
    0.2.29
        * INSTALL: Windows notice removed. Added less(1) as a weak dependency.
        * `make dist`: Include "testcfg" as it's needed by something in
            test.py.
        * anonymine_engine.py (hiscores (display)): Bugfix:
            UnicodeDecodeError on localized weekday abbreviations.

            The IO error table didn't work as hiscores was None rather than []
        * (All python modules): Allow running as root on Haiku.
        *: New file INSTALL.Haiku.
        *: Moved Windows.txt to INSTALL.Windows to match the new pattern.

2016-08-11      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.2.27
        * Makefile.static (print-destinations): Fixed syntax error.
        * Makefile.static (release): Added verbose messages, added new
            target "test" as a synonym for "check".
    0.2.26
        * anonymine.py (highscores_display):
            - Add -# 1 as options to less.
            - Allow subprocess to fail.
        * README: Added some notes about the tested platforms.
            Minix 3 and openindiana no longer work.
        * mkenginecfg:
            - seq(1) is apparently a GNU specific utility.
            - Added quotes around $nproc to let the Python script succeed
              even if no method of counting processors worked.

2016-08-10      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>

        * README: Dropped goal 0.5: statistics module. Rephrased 0.6(->0.5)
        * test.py: Removed functions that depend on the deprecated statistics
            functions.

2016-08-08      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.2.23
        *: New file: HACKING, RELEASE-NOTES
        * README: Moved file listing to HACKING.
        * Makefile.static: $$ doesn't work on FreeBSD's make, it needs to be
            $$$$ which doesn't work on gmake.
            - Created a small shellscript to be invoked from `make dist`.
            - Hard coded the icons sizes. Ugh.
        * Makefile.static ($(MAIN_STAGE)): Depend on Makefile.static to
            force the correct version number.
        * Makefile.static (dist): Don't depend on zip and tarballs. Doing
            that will cause issues with parallel make.
        * Makefile.static, configure.py, RELEASE-NOTES, INSTALL: Changed the
            values for freedesktop, macosx and windows to the unambiguous true
            or false.

2016-07-19      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.2.22
        * anonymine_engine.py (hiscores (display)): Www HH:MM goes back to
            six days; Added "(Future)"
        * configure.py, Makefile.static, anonymine.py, INSTALL: Allow
            $(sysconfdir) to be anything.
        * INSTALL: Modified.

2016-07-18      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.2.21
        * Makefile.static, anonymine.py, configure: Moved version numbering
            into Makefile.static only to simplify version bumping.
    0.2.20
        * cursescfg:  Difficult to see anything in B&W mode: Change '?' to '.'
            to increase the visual difference between flags and free cells.
        * INSTALL: Updated to match these changes:
        * Makefile.static: Disabled overwrite-cfg due to the new behavior
            of check-install-cfg.
        * install-cfg:
            - Wrote docstrings
            - Changed return values for `decide`
            - Tell which configuration file is incompatible and refer to the
              source file.
        * install-cfg, Configuration files: Added support for a status quo
            marker line.  If the magic line can be found in the destination
            file, it will be overwritten.
        * install-cfg, Makefile.static (check-install-cfg): Send the verbose
            variable to ./install-cfg to make it shut up if it has nothing
            exceptional to say.

2016-07-17      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.2.19
        * cursescfg: Hexagonal grid was still too bright -> set to A_DIM,
            text does not need to be bright.
        * anonymine.py (highscores_add_entry): Fixed double-prompt for nickname.
    0.2.18
        * anonymine.py, BUGS: Got away with only redrawing on the first click
            (initialization).  This was previously a potential performance
            issue.
        * cursescfg: Bright/bold magenta was too bright for the hexagonal grid.
    0.2.17
        * BUGS, anonymine.py: #9, use a different fix.
            - `ask` modified to handle EINTR
            - New function `output` created as wrapper.
            - Added 'str' as paramtype to `convert_param`
        * anonymine_engine.py (game_engine.init_field2):
            - Handle EINTR on os.wait, os.fork already does this
              unintentionally.
            - raise security_alert rather than Exception for the timeout alarm.
              (except Exception caught lots of other stuff.)

    0.2.16
        * anonymine_engine.py (hiscores), etc: Force UTF-8 on the file.
            - Functions may return unicode objects as strings on Python 2, but
              that's no problem as unicode and str can be combined as long as
              the str only contains bytes in the ASCII range.
            - add_entry, will decode the str object on Python 2 using
              locale.getprefferedencoding() as encoding
            - The maxsize key now refers to the number of bytes on both
              Pythons.
            - Added a nick-maxlen key to limit the length of nicknames.
        * anonymine.py (highscores_add_entry): sys.stdin.readline may raise
            UnicodeDecodeError on Python 3. Grr.
        * anonymine_engine.py (init_field2): open(file, 'x') raised ValueError
            on Python 3.2, **try** 'wx' and then 'x', and if both fail, 'w'.
        * mkenginecfg, enginecfg.default: entries set to 16, previously: 10

    0.2.14
        * Makefile.static: Undo change in 0.2.9 causing configuration files
            to not be installed in clean environments:
            - install-dirs now installs CFG_DIR and $(DESTDIR)$(vargamesdir)
            Apparently, install
    0.2.13
        * configure.py: BUGFIX in many find_ functions:
            Don't use Makefile[var] for checking the existence of directories,

            $(prefix)/var both exists and doesn't.
    0.2.12

            - Removed #0
        * configure.py:  Wrote missing doc-strings.
        * configure.py:  Moved default Makefile variables from getargs to main.
    0.2.10
        * anonymine_engine.py (init_field2):
            - Use SIGTERM to kill children if SIGCONT is unavailable.
            - Allow fork() to fail.
            - Use signal.alarm() in a more elegant way.
            - Add 64 bits of entropy to the tempfiles, just in case
              open(file, 'wx') fails to do its trick.

    0.2.7
        * anonymine_engine.py anonymine.py: Python 3 fixes:
            - anonymine_engine.hiscores.display.format_deltatime formatted
              the ms part as gibberish. [Fixed]
            - anonymine.play_game, anonymine.highscores_add_entry did not

            actually made it to the list.

        * anonymine_engine.py: New classes: hiscores, hiscores_dummy
        * anonymine_engine.py (game_engine (play_game)): Create a `hiscores`
            object.
            Second return argument is now a `hiscores` object, previously
            it was a float representing the time it took to win or lose.
        * anonymine_engine.py (game_engine (__init__)): Added self.dimensions
            and self.flagcount to allow `play_game` to create a proper
            paramstring for hiscores.__init__.


2016-07-07      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>

            - Added a sanity check.
        * configure.py: Fix verbosity setting for Makefile.
            Give Makefile verbose=false as default and verbose=true
            if the -v flag was used.
        * Makefile.static (overwrite-cfg):
            Use $(info) instead of echo.
        * Makefile.static (dist, tarballs, zip):
            Don't bother writing out the "Depends on tarballs and zip"
            message as that itself depends on those two targets.
            Messages are now printed by zip and tarballs.
    0.2.1
        * NEWS: Changes from 0.1.0 to 0.2.0

    0.0.43
        *: New files: FAQ, FILES
        * Windows-user.bat: LF->CRLF
        * Makefile.static (dist): New targets: dist, release, tarballs, zip

            it choose a prefix that will work.
        * Windows.bat -> (Windows-admin.bat, Windows-user.bat):  Made a
            separate bitch file for non-admin installation.

2016-01-30      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.0.40
        * Makefile.static (check), check.sh, check.py:
            Added a 'check' target and made it a dependency of 'dist'.
            This should prevent embarrassing releases.
    0.0.39
        * anonymine_engine.py (game_engine.init_field2):
            0.0.38 didn't work on Python 2.
            The tempfile need to be opened in 'wx' mode on Python 2
            and 'x' mode on Python 3.

2016-01-29      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.0.38
        * anonymine_engine.py, anonymine_fields.py, anonymine_solver.py:

        * anonymine_engine.py (game_engine.init_field2):
            Open files with 'x', and assert that they are not symlinks.
            (To avoid mktemp(3)ish race-conditions.)

2016-01-24      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.0.37
        * anonymine_fields.py (hexagonal_field): Made the doc-string
            a raw string.
        * anonymine_solver.py:
            - s/dame/same/.
            - Added `solver.cumulated_levels_failure`.
            - Completed the doc-strings.
            - Added the 'T' level for the time it took.
        * test.py: Added a doc-string and removed some crap.
        * cursescfg: Fixed some forgotten comments. (0.0.36)
    0.0.36
        * cursescfg: Changed the foreground of 'background' to BLUE
            to hide the remaining effects of BUG#3
        * ChangeLog (0.0.28): No such file: engine.py
        * anonymine_engine.py (game_engine): Removed init_field1.
        * enginecfg: Removed the 'wait' key and wrapped long lines.
        * anonymine.py (user_input), cursescfg: Key bindings:
            Merged 'doc-moore' and 'doc-neumann' into 'doc-square'.
        * anonymine.py: Fixed the fix for the fix for the interesting
            NetBSD bug.  The game will now always exit with the
            appropriate exit code.
        * anonymine_fields.py:
            - Why the hell would these classes need a '__hash__' method?
            - Eliminated empty doc-strings from `hexagonal_field`.
            - Wrote the empty doc-strings for `generic_field`.
            - Wrote a main doc-string for the module.
        * anonymine_engine.py:
            Moved the first doc-string above the 'import' statements to
            prevent displaying some boring FreeBSD license as doc-string.
    0.0.35
        * anonymine (curses_game) (__init__, input, travel):
            It is now possible to move diagonally in the von Neumann mode.
        * BUGS:

        * portability: Removed the "Terminals" section.

2016-01-18      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.0.34
        * anonymine_fields.py, anonymine_engine.py: Python 3 bugfixes:
            Forgot to wrap map() in list() causing the game to crash
            when it places the mines and of some reason integer arithmetic
            became floating point in the fields module.
    
    0.0.33
        * BUGS: BUG#4 was rejected. P(BUG#2) < 1/250250
        * anonymine.py: The fix for for the interesting Python bug on
            NetBSD causes exceptions to be raised when ^Cing the game
            on Python 3.
            Change:
                - Python 3 on NetBSD will always exit 0.
                - Python 3 on other systems that hang on exit will hang.
                - Python 2 on other systems that hang on exit will exit
                    appropriately.
                - Will exit appropriately on systems that don't hang
                    on exit.
        * configure.py: Fixed the fix for the NetBSD related bug:
            Don't raise SystemExit(1) on error, use os._exit() instead.
        * anonymine_fields.py: Renewed the `generic_field` class as
            _deref caused some confusion if used more than once.
            Performance is about the same.
        * anonymine_fields.py: Completed the doc-strings.
        * INSTALL: Added some important notes about python symlinks.
        *: New file: GOALS.

2016-01-13      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.0.32
        * Makefile.static: Commented out the $(PRE_INSTALL), $(NORMAL_INSTALL)
            and $(POST_INSTALL) lines as they caused trouble on NetBSD and
            OpenBSD.
        * cursescfg (curses-output/free): Create visual difference between
            free cells and background when color is disabled.
        * configure.py, anonymine: Use os._exit(0) at the end of all "running"
            code to work around an interesting Python bug on NetBSD.
        * BUGS: Removed #4 (0.0.30), added #4 (Not finding Python 3 on
            Open- and NetBSD.)
            Update status on BUG#2. P(bug) < 1/103697
        * configure.py:
            Added $(prefix) as a variable to print in verbose mode.
    0.0.31
        * Makefile.static, configure.py, install-cfg: Try to use
            /usr/ucb/install when available for compatibility with
            openindiana and probably other Solares.
        * anonymine.py: Allow `curses.curs_set(0)` to fail for compatibility
            with Minix 3.
        * configure.py: Change $(prefix) to something appropriate.
        * INSTALL, configure.py: Implement a -w option to use the old/wrong
            prefix.

2016-01-12      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>

            Added a list of untested, but important, platforms.
        * BUGS:
            Added a bug#4 which occurs on Minix 3.3.
    0.0.29
        * Makefile.static (overwrite-cfg): Bugfix: initcfg to enginecfg.
            `grep initcfg -- ./*` confirms that this bug is finally solved.
        *: Introduced crapfile 'LICENSE'.
        * BUGS: Made a small correction to BUG#3 and added defined "since"
            as >=77818 fields.
        * anonymine_solver.py: Removed the "-1 frequency of diffifculty"
            profiling code.
        * anonymine_fields.py (generic_field):
            Added a description of the coordinate system to the doc-string.
        * portability: Added OpenSUSE as properly behaving, removed Debian 8
            as problematic. Learned the alphabet.
    0.0.28
        * anonymine_engine.py (game_engine):
            * (init_field, init_field1, init_field2):
                `init_field` now takes care of the traditional/stupid mode.
                And the method of generating guessless minefields has been
                improved.
        * anonymine_engine.py (game_engine.place_mines):
            REMOVED as it is no longer needed.
        * enginecfg:
            Reconfigured to work better with init_field2.
        * INSTALL:
            Bugfix "-i initcfg" to "-e enginecfg".

    0.0.27
        * BUGS, portability:

        * anonymine.py (curses_game.input):
        * anonymine.py (curses_game.output):
            Fixed a platform specific bug. (#3).

    0.0.26
        * anonymine_solver.py (solver.number_neighbours):
            Only add cells to the list that are not already in it.
            Makes the solver 4x as fast.
        * anonymine_solver.py, anonymine_fields.py:
            Closer inspection of the caching of neighbours gives a speed
            multiplier of 2.5.
            The solver is now approx 10x as fast as in version 0.0.23.
    0.0.25
        * anonymine_solver.py (solver.rule9bf): The bug found at 0.0.24
            might have been found.  It was checking if a free cell was a
            neighbour to EACH unsolved cell rather than to ANY unsolved
            cell.
            I will run a bugcatcher to verify that the bug that may or may
            not exist, is very improbable to occur.

2016-01-07      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.0.24
        * anonymine_fields.py (generic_field):
            Cache the lists returned by `generic_field.get_neighbours`.

            While profiling, a bug was found: the solver made a mistake

2016-01-06      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.0.23
        * configure.py (getargs): Now works on Python 2.5.5 (which is too
            old for this game).
        * configure.py, INSTALL: Allow three flags/short options:
            -f force
            -v verbose
    0.0.22
        * configure.py, configure, INSTALL: Installation is more customisable
            with directory variables now being supported by the configure.py
            script.  srcdir, builddir, DESTDIR, prefix, bindir, gamesdir,
            libdir, EXECUTABLES, MODULES, MODULES_OTHERVER
        * configure.py: Try to get this to work on Python 2.5.
        * Makefile.static: Have 'check-install-cfg' as a dependency of
            'install' in the hope of that this will prevent installing
            if the pre-existing configuration files are incompatible.
        * Makefile.static: Cosmetic changes at the top comments.
        * Makefile.static: Renamed 'to-where' to 'print-destinations'.
        * Makefile.static (dist): cd into $(builddir) and use relative paths
            when making the tar.

2016-01-06      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.0.21

            longer required.  It is still used if it exists.
        * Makefile.static: Don't rename /etc/anonymine/initcfg to
            /etc/anonymine/enginecfg as this will cause confusion when
            combined with $(DESTDIR) and is not needed.
        * Makefile.static: $(PRE_INSTALL) and $(NORMAL_INSTALL) have been
            inserted.
    0.0.19
        * ChangeLog (0.0.17): Oops: It was modified, but I forgot to save.

            directives in the future.
        * anonymine.py: Global replace "initcfg" with "enginecfg".
        * anonymine.py (play_game), anonymine_engine.py (game_engine.__init__):

            instead.
        * anonymine.py (arg_input): -i to -e.
        * anonymine.py (play_game): Corrected the doc-string's description
            of enginecfg. (Previously specific to field initialization.)
        * Makefile.static: Attempt to rename a pre-existing "initcfg" to
            "enginecfg"
        * anonymine.py (arg_input): Improved help text for the -e and -c
            options.

            fixed.
        * Makefile.static: New files: "BUGS" and "portability".

            * "signal" WILL exist; no need for try/except.
            * The warning about "argparse" not being available was hard to
              read as it was on the top of the screen.
    0.0.16
        * ChangeLog (0.0.15): str.format is new in Python 2.6, no lower version
            possible.
        * cursescfg: A_BLINK was annoying on the cursor for square fields.
        * anonymine.py (ask): Quit immediately on ^C, don't ask.
        * configure.py: Check dependencies.
        * INSTALL: Mention dependencies.
        * Makefile.static: Print out MODULES_OTHERVER on make install.

        * anonymine.py, anonymine.py (maindoc): Added a doc-string for the
            whole module, currently empty.
        * anonymine.py (ask, convert_param): Wrote the doc-strings.
        * anonymine.py (convert_params): Renamed to convert_param as it takes
            one parameter.
        * anonymine.py (convert_param):
            * Allow '4', '6', '8' and 'hexagonal' as `s` when
                paramtype == "gametype".

                usable for re-use.
            * Improved the Easter egg for paramtype=='dimension'.
    0.0.12
        * anonymine.py (curses_game): Wrote the remaining doc-strings.
        * anonymine.py (curses_game.print_hex, curses_game.print_square):
            The area mentioned in the doc-strings accidentally included the
            bottom line (currently used for the flags left text).
        * anonymine.py (curses_game): Replaced `self.coordinate` with
            `self.cursor` to remove some confusion.
        * anonymine.py (curses_game.print_hex): Made the doc-string a
            raw string due to the backslashes.
        * ChangeLog (0.0.9): `convert_params` did already exist, the new thing
            was 'reverse-minecount'.
    0.0.11
        * anonymine.py (curses_game): Wrote some doc-strings.
        * anonymine.py: Fixed the "printing of traceback without fucking
            up terminal".
            Previous behaviour: complain about curses.endwin() before
            initialization.

2016-01-03      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.0.10

            20%) rather than the hard coded 16%.
2016-01-02      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>

            tests should be done.  Modules only available in the default
            version of Python.
    0.0.6
        * anonymine.py (user_input), cursescfg: Provide in-game documentation
            on the key bindings.
        * Makefile.static (install):
            Moved the configuration installation lines higher up to prevent
            installing something that can't use the available configuration.
    0.0.5
        * cursescfg: Various improvements including compacting, documenting,
            notifying about potential future incompatibility and rethinking
            hexagonal steering.
    0.0.4
        * anonymine.py (curses_game.message): Bugfix: messages will now
            be split into many lines if it doesn't fit in one.
            Previous behaviour: crash.
        * anonymine.py (curses_game.__init__): Limit screen sizes to a minimum
            of 7 columns and 4 rows.
        * anonymine.py (curses_game.output): Always decrease the available
            height, not only when the flags left message doesn't fit.
            Seems to fix a resizing bug that traces to curses_game.print_char.
    0.0.3
        * Makefile, Makefile.static, configure, configure.py:
            A simple configure script has been written.
            Manual modification of the Makefile no longer needed.
        * INSTALL: Updated to match the current installation procedure.
    0.0.2
        * Makefile, install-cfg: Created a small python script to prevent
            overwriting potentially modified configuration files.
            Added the rule "overwrite-cfg" to the Makefile.
        * Makefile: @ed out all lines; added echo(1)es to tell what is being
            done.
        * INSTALL: Mentioning the install-cfg script and the overwrite-cfg
            rule.
    0.0.1
        * Makefile: Avoiding the use of `install -t` as it doesn't work on
            at least FreeBSD.
