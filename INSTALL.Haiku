I haven't yet figured out how to get it installed on Haiku, but it plays
acceptably well.

On Haiku nighlty hrev < 50662, the screen may look like gibberish.  Use
TERM=vt100 on Haiku versions older than 50662.

(Tested on Haiku nightly build hrev50483 and hrev50700.)

To "install" it
$ git clone https://github.com/oskar-skog/anonymine.git
$ cd anonymine
$ touch highscores
$ ./mkenginecfg ./ ./ highscores

To play it
$ cd anonymine
$ python anonymine.py -c cursescfg -e enginecfg.out
